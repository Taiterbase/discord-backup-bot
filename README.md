# nZifi
This uses discord.js and the discord-backup framework. Thank you to both of these projects for making this one possible.  

This tool is used to backup university discord groups and formal college courses that host themselves on Discord. I developed it alongside some cron tooling and rebranded it to fit the purpose of saving chat histories and other Discord server data to university drives.
